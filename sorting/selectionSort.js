PROBLEM DOMAIN :
Implement selection sort


EXAMPLE :
array = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];

return -> [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 44, 63, 87, 99, 283]


ALGORITHM :
- Iterate through the array
- Create variables to keep track of minimum value and temp value
- For each index of the array, iterate through the array again to update the minimum value
- If the minimum value of that iteration is less than index you are on, swap it with the minimum


SOLUTION:
*/
const selectionSort = (array) => {
	const length = array.length;
};
