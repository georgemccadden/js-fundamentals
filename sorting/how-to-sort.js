PROBLEM DOMAINS :
Determine which sorting algorithm to use given the following circumstances.

Sort 10 schools around your house by distance -> Insertion sort

eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount -> Radix sort / Counting sort

Sports scores on ESPN -> Quick sort

Massive database (which cannot fit into memory) needs to be sorted through the past year's user data -> Merge sort

Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews -> Insertion sort / Bubble sort

Temperature records for the past 50 years in Canada -> Radix sort / Counting sort / Quick sort (If the data is in decimal)

Large username database needs to be sorted. (Data is very random) -> Merge sort (If memory isn't too expensive) / Quick sort (If the database isn't too large)

You want to teach sorting for the first time -> Bubble sort / Selection sort
